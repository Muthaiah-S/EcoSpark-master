            <div class="content">Processing e-waste at home can be risky due to the hazardous materials involved in
                electronics. However, there are safe and practical steps you can take to manage small amounts of e-waste
                responsibly without professional equipment:

                <h3>1. Reuse or Repurpose:</h3>
                Repurpose Old Devices: Old smartphones, tablets, or laptops can be repurposed for specific uses such as
                media servers, digital photo frames, or home security cameras.
                Salvage Components: Extract reusable parts from old devices like hard drives, RAM, or batteries, which
                can be used in DIY projects or other devices.
                DIY Projects: Old electronics can be used in creative projects, such as making clocks, robots, or
                experimental electronics using parts like sensors, motors, and screens.

                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    2. Safe Dismantling (Only for Small Devices):</h3>
                Safety First: Always wear gloves, goggles, and a mask to protect yourself from harmful chemicals and
                sharp edges.
                Extract Metals: Carefully dismantle old electronics to recover valuable metals like copper from wires or
                aluminum from casings.
                Separate Materials: As you disassemble, separate materials into categories (plastic, metal, and
                circuitry) to recycle them later at a facility.
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    3. Recycling E-waste:</h3>
                Designated Drop-Offs: Look for local e-waste recycling events or centers where you can drop off parts
                that you cannot safely recycle at home.
                Recycling Components:
                Batteries: Take used batteries to designated collection points, as they contain toxic chemicals.
                Circuit Boards: Motherboards and circuit boards contain valuable metals like gold, silver, and copper,
                which should be recycled by professionals.
                Certified Recyclers: For complex e-waste (like laptops, TVs, or refrigerators), contact certified
                e-waste recyclers who specialize in safely processing and extracting reusable materials.
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    4. Upcycling for Home Use:</h3>
                Old Keyboards: Convert an old keyboard into a retro lamp or use keys for creative art projects.
                CDs and DVDs: Use old CDs or DVDs for decorative art, coasters, or mirrors.
                Hard Drives: Turn old hard drives into external storage by purchasing external casing kits, which allow
                you to reuse the hard drive as portable storage.
                <br><br>
                <h3>
                    5. Data Security:</h3>
                Wipe Data: Before recycling or repurposing any device, ensure all personal data is wiped. Use software
                tools to securely erase data from hard drives or reset devices to factory settings.
                Handling e-waste at home should focus more on repurposing and safely separating components, while
                ensuring hazardous waste like batteries and circuit boards is given to certified recyclers for proper
                disposal.

            <div class="content">
                Electronic waste, often known as e-waste, is when any electronic equipment becomes unsuitable for its
                intended purpose or passes its expiry date. Because of quick technical breakthroughs and the
                manufacturing of new electronic equipment are now taking place of older versions of the equipment. It
                has resulted in exponential growth of e-waste, notably in India. People tend to upgrade to newer models
                and cutting-edge technology, and product lifespans shorten with time. This calls for urgent need for
                e-waste management in India.

                E-waste recycling is an activity of the informal sector in India. Thousands of impoverished families
                make a living by scavenging stuff from garbage dumps. Common recycling procedures for middle-class urban
                families, notably for waste paper, plastic, clothes, or metal, are to sell to small-scale, informal
                sector purchasers known as ‘kabadiwalas,’ who then sort and sell it as an input material to artisanal or
                for industrial use.
                <br><br>
                In India, e-waste management follows a similar approach. Thousands of urban families are employed in an
                informal e-waste recycling industry to collect, classify, repair, refurbish, and disassemble outdated
                electronic equipment. However, in developed nations, the situation is different, and there is no idea in
                India of customers willingly giving obsolete electrical and electronic equipment at formal e-waste
                disposal sites. Similarly, there is no idea of customers paying for the disposal of e-waste that they
                create.
                <br><br>

                How can we Create Robust E-waste Management in India?<br>
                We are always assessing the efficacy of e-waste management. There could be a few measures for
                consideration to move forward.

                Strengthen the Informal Sector
                Policy Instruments under EPR
                Regulatory Enforcement
                Public Awareness for E-waste Management
                The management of e-waste in India is a major concern for governments in many developing nations. It is
                rapidly becoming a public health concern, with the number of cases growing at an alarming rate. E-waste
                must be collected separately, appropriately processed, and disposed off. It is also an alternative to
                traditional landfills and open burning. It is critical to combine the informal and formal sectors.
                Competent authorities in developing nations such as India must build processes for securely and
                sustainably processing and disposing of e-waste.
